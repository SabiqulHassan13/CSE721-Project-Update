# CSE721-Project-Update


🔐 Classic Cryptography Toolkit & Hill Cipher Crypto-Cracker

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of classic cryptographic algorithms and a known-plaintext attack tool for the Hill Cipher, developed as part of a Master’s level 
Introduction to Cryptography course assignment.

📁 Repository Contents

Part 1 – Classic Cipher Tool (Google Colab Notebook)

Caesar Cipher

Affine Cipher

Playfair Cipher

Hill Cipher (2×2 key matrix)

Supports encryption and decryption with interactive, user-friendly console interface

Part 2 – Hill Cipher Crypto-Cracker (Google Colab Notebook)

Implements Known Plaintext Attack (KPA)

Recovers the secret 2×2 Hill cipher key

Demonstrates successful and failed attack scenarios

Includes key verification
